# python-flask-rest-api
REST API Template using Flask. 
- Basic Authentication using Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB)  
- API versioning with Flask Blueprints
- Settings saved in env variables

This is a really simple REST API Template I created while learning a little bit of Python.  
I use it for my microservices in the company running as Azure App Service.

## Create Testing Environment
- Setup your python environment properly
- Clone the repository
- Rename the .env_Example file to .env
  - There's a Test-User "Test" with Password "Hello" (encrypted with passwordhash() function)
- Run the app
